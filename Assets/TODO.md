- make the road
<!-- - make the camera just like the video one -->
<!-- - put trigger colliders on each turning point with specified max speed, if current speed is greater than max speed for that turn, car will go off track -->
<!-- - show ui for this max speed like a sign board on the side of the road -->
<!-- - show current speed ui -->
<!-- - show a timer ui as well, you have to finish the laps or reach the finish point before this timer goes to zero -->
<!-- - use rb.addforce for moving vehicle -->
- drift the vehicle on turns (change the rotation of car and wheel while drifting)
- on the road, add drift marks
- add particle effect on car wheels like smoke while drifting
- add sfx

- add a scene b/w main menu and level 1 to introduce 操作方法 and 目的, you can make it just some fancy texts that will comeup on the screen with some animation or you could introduce with an actual demo gameplay or no need to make separate scene, just put the instructions in level 1
